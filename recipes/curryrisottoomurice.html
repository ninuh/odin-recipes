        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sōma's dish for the Preliminary Round of the 43rd Annual Tōtsuki Autumn Election. This dish is a fusion of Sōma's past mistakes, combining the Mini Soufflé Omelette, which almost got him expelled during the Tōtsuki Friendship and Rapport Training and his Apple Risotto, which resulted in his 490th loss against his father. Pressing a spoon on it causes an aroma explosion stemming from his usage of Mango Chutney. It is a dish worthy enough to challenge the spice expert Akira Hayama, who was guaranteed to be the top prospect of the preliminaries.
