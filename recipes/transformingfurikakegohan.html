        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>An original take on the classical Furikake Gohan, the Yukihira style uses eggs coated by a golden coating using chilled chicken broth to create a golden jewel from the simplest ingredients.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <h4>Main Dish</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Beef Sirloin (Supermarket discount)</li>
            <li>Lots of Onion</li>
            <li>Garlic (mix with onion)</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Potato Starch</li>
            <li>Rice (Donburi Bowl)</li>
            <li>Umeboshi Paste</li>
            <li>Pickled Plum</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Sauce</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Red Wine</li>
            <li>Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>How to Cook</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop the onions finely.</li>
            <li>Remove the tendons from the beef and beat it with a meat tenderizer until as flat as possible.</li>
            <li>Cover meat on both sides with the chopped onion and leave for 30 minutes or more. Remove the onion and add salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Cook the steak to your preference(most would prefer medium-rare). Remove from heat and melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a frying pan and fry the onion used for the beef until it changes color. Adjust the flavor with salt and pepper, then move the onion to the steak.</li>
            <li>Melt the remaining butter in the frying pan and fry the sides of the meat before taking it out.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Making the Sauce:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Add red wine to the frying pan used for the beef to deglaze it. Boil down the wine while scraping off the meat juice.</li>
            <li>Add soy sauce and mix with everything. Adjust seasonings to personal preferences.</li>
            <li>Thicken with dissolved potato starch.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Put rice mixed with Umeboshi paste (pickled plum) in the donburi bowl. Place the beef on top and add plenty of sauce. Top with the finely chopped, cooked onions.</p>
